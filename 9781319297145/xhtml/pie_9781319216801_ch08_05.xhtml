<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_FawabbhgN9">Polyploidy is common in plants and is a major mechanism by which new plant species have evolved. Approximately 40% of all flowering-plant species and 70% to 80% of grasses are polyploids. A number of agriculturally important plants are polyploid, including wheat, oats, cotton, potatoes, and sugarcane. Polyploidy is less common in animals but is found in some invertebrates, fishes, salamanders, frogs, and lizards. No naturally occurring, viable polyploids are known in birds or mammals.</p>

Nondisjunction of all chromosomes in mitosis in an early 2<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_ffrJpRdblQ">n</i> embryo, for example, doubles the chromosome number and produces an autotetraploid (4<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_kH7YM486Lo">n</i>), as depicted in <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_YOwb2KjtCK" id="ben_9781319297145_5e9n2HhZ9J"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_h8ZTc4SdTC">Figure 8.26a</strong></a>.

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_VJyITYDkng">Because all the chromosome sets in autopolyploids are from the same species, they are homologous and attempt to align in prophase I of meiosis, which usually results in sterility. Consider meiosis in an autotriploid (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_7A51mqhafF" id="ben_9781319297145_EWtrPhWIXG"><strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_COHLHyrDOV">Figure 8.27</strong></a>). <span aria-label="243" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page243" role="doc-pagebreak" title="243"/>In meiosis in a diploid cell, two homologs pair and align, but in autotriploids, three homologs are present. One of the three homologs may fail to align with the other two, and this unaligned chromosome will segregate randomly (see <a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_7A51mqhafF" id="ben_9781319297145_tOfSMKOFIg">Figure 8.27a</a>). Which gamete gets the extra chromosome will be determined by chance and will differ for each homologous trio of chromosomes. The resulting gametes will have two copies of some chromosomes and one copy of others.

A gamete produced by meiosis in such an autotriploid might receive, say, two copies of chromosome 1, one copy of chromosome 2, three copies of chromosome 3, and no copies of chromosome 4. When the unbalanced gamete fuses with a normal gamete (or with another unbalanced gamete), the resulting zygote has different numbers of the four types of chromosomes. This difference in number creates unbalanced gene dosage in the zygote, which is often lethal. For this reason, triploids do not usually produce viable offspring.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_LqqTmVJ9bg">In even-numbered autopolyploids, such as autotetraploids, the homologous chromosomes can theoretically form pairs and divide equally.

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_qaUlYqqrBx">In many organisms, cell volume is correlated with nuclear volume, which in turn is determined by genome size. Thus, the increase in chromosome number in polyploidy is often associated with an increase in cell size, and many polyploids are physically larger than diploids. Breeders have used this effect to produce plants with larger leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. For example, as discussed in the introduction to the chapter, modern wheat is hexaploid (6<i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_RrbYjWznl0">n</i> = 42) with chromosomes derived from three different wild species (<a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_01.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_FwpQQi9ocq" id="ben_9781319297145_07VE4jrZlP">Figure 8.1</a>). As a result, the seeds of modern wheat are larger than those of its ancestors. Cultivated bananas are often polyploid. Most strains were created by crossing plants within and between two diploid species: <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_vSb6rdCj8V">Musa acuminata</i> (genome = AA) and <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_qXJNxETlo9">Musa balbisiana</i> (genome = BB). Many cultivated strains are triploid, with three sets of chromosomes (AAA, AAB, or ABB), and others are tetraploid (AAAA, AAAB, AABB, or ABBB). Polyploid bananas generally have larger fruits than diploid bananas and many are seedless, making them more edible. Many other cultivated plants are also polyploid (<strong class="important" id="ben_9781319297145_NeJQrTOQQe"><a class="crossref" href="pie_9781319216801_ch08_05.xhtml#ben_9781319297145_UPP0aDXIH0" id="ben_9781319297145_z0FmCyQF6F">Table 8.2</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_KN87KszGo3">Polyploidy is less common in animals than in plants for several reasons. As discussed, allopolyploids require hybridization between different species, which happens less frequently in animals than in plants. Animal behavior often prevents interbreeding among species, and the complexity of animal development causes most interspecific hybrids to be nonviable. Many of the polyploid animals that do arise are in groups that reproduce through parthenogenesis (a type of reproduction in which the animal develops from an unfertilized egg). Thus, asexual reproduction may facilitate the development of polyploids, perhaps because the perpetuation of hybrid individuals through asexual reproduction provides greater opportunities for nondisjunction than does sexual reproduction. Only a few human polyploid babies have been reported, and most died <span aria-label="246" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page246" role="doc-pagebreak" title="246"/>within a few days of birth. Polyploidy—usually triploidy—is seen in about 10% of all spontaneously aborted human fetuses.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ben_9781319297145_S0MtjOSnxt">Although complete polyploidy, in which all cells are polyploid, is lethal in humans, significant numbers of autopolyploid cells do occur in some human tissues. For example, some liver cells and heart cells are polyploid. Although the reason for polyploidy in these cells is unknown, the large cell size that results from polyploidy might be advantageous under certain circumstances. Polyploid cells are also found in many cancers. One study suggested that extra sets of chromosomes occur in 37% of all cancers.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_fZCg6qh5Jd">Polyploidy, particularly allopolyploidy, often gives rise to new species and has been particularly important in the evolution of flowering plants. Occasional genome doubling through polyploidy has been a major contributor to evolutionary success in several groups. For example, <i class="semantic-i" id="ben_9781319297145_J0vtKx8gCv">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (yeast) is a tetraploid, having undergone whole-genome duplication about 100 million years ago. The vertebrate genome has duplicated twice, once in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates and again in the ancestor of fishes. Certain groups of vertebrates, such as some frogs and some fishes, have undergone additional duplications. Cereal plants have undergone several genome-duplication events.</p>

<p class="noindent" id="ben_9781319297145_142kmLFTIs">Polyploidy is the presence of extra chromosome sets. Autopolyploids possess extra chromosome sets from the same species; allopolyploids possess extra chromosome sets from two or more species. Problems in chromosome pairing and segregation often lead to sterility in autopolyploids, but many allopolyploids are fertile.</p>
